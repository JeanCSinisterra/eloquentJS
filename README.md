# Eloquent JavaScript
This repository contains my solutions to the various exercises and practices found in the book "Eloquent JavaScript" by Marijn Haverbeke. It serves as a record of my progress and understanding of the concepts presented in the book. The book covers a range of topics, from basic programming principles to more advanced concepts like higher-order functions, object-oriented programming, and asynchronous programming.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into chapters, corresponding to the chapters in the "Eloquent JavaScript" book. Each chapter's directory contains subdirectories for exercises and practices found within that chapter. Here's an overview of the structure:
├── chapter-01/
│   ├── exercises/
│   └── practices/
├── chapter-02/
│   ├── exercises/
│   └── practices/
├── chapter-03/
│   ├── exercises/
│   └── practices/
├── ...
├── chapter-n/
│   ├── exercises/
│   └── practices/
└── README.md

In each chapter's exercises and practices directories, you'll find my solutions written in JavaScript. I've named the files descriptively to indicate which exercise or practice they correspond to.
